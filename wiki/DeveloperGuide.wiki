#summary Developer's Guide

==== Introduction ====
This guide is for software developers who would like to work on the source code of
ics-os. The suggested development platform is a linux box with development tools 
installed. The following packages should be available on the development machine.

  * make
  * gcc/tcc
  * GNU binutils (ld, strip)
  * mount
  * bochs
  * nasm

Instructions for installing the above packages differ from one linux distribution to another. Consult the documentation for the distribution that you use.

==== Obtaining the Source Code ====
To obtain the source code for ics-os, visit the http://code.google.com/p/ics-os/downloads/list. 
You can also access the latest snapshot of the source tree via Subversion by following the instructions at http://code.google.com/p/ics-os/source/checkout.

==== Building the Source Code ====
Building the source code for the kernel and the distribution disk is accomplished using {{{ make }}}. 

  # First extract the source distribution .tar.gz.
{{{
$tar xzvf ics-os-121808.tar.gz
}}}
  # Next, go inside the directory of the extracted source
{{{
$cd ics-os
}}}
  # Build the kernel
{{{
$make
}}}
  # Build the distribution floppy image. Make sure that you have root privileges.
{{{
#make install
}}}
  # Test the distribution floppy image. This does not require root privileges.
{{{
$bochs -q
}}}
