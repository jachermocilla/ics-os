#summary User Guide

=== Introduction ===
The primary user interface in ics-os is the command line. After a successful startup, the
command prompt will appear and you can begin typing commands. 
{{{
/ics-os/%
}}}
To enter commands, you must type the name of the command then press enter. For example, 
to display the list of files in the current directory, use the command {{{ls}}}.
{{{
/ics-os/%ls
}}}
The commands can be categorized into two types namely Internal and Application. Internal 
commands are "built" into ics-os and {{{ls}}} is an example. Application commands on the other hand are separate programs that perform user specific functions. To view the list of 
internal commands, type {{{help}}} on the prompt then press enter.
{{{
/ics-os/%help
}}}
