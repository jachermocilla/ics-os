#summary Downloading and Installing ICS-OS.

== Floppy Install==

ICS-OS fits in a single 1.44MB floppy disk. The fastest way to test ICS-OS is to download the latest floppy disk <a href="http://ics-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ics-os/ics-os-floppy.img">image</a> and write it directly to a floppy disk.

In linux, you can use the {{{ dd }}} command
{{{
#dd if=ics-os-floppy of=/dev/fd0 bs=2880
}}}
If the write is successful, test the floppy by rebooting your PC. Make sure that the floppy comes first in the boot device priority in the BIOS setup.
