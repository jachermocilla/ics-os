#summary Downloading and Installing ICS-OS.

== Floppy Install==

ICS-OS fits in a single 1.44MB floppy disk. The fastest way to test ICS-OS is to download the latest floppy disk <a href="http://ics-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ics-os/ics-os-floppy.img">image</a> and write it directly to a floppy disk.

In linux, you can use the {{{ dd }}} command
{{{
#dd if=ics-os-floppy of=/dev/fd0 bs=2880
}}}
If the write is successful, test the floppy by rebooting your PC. Make sure that the floppy comes first in the boot device priority in the BIOS setup.


== Bochs Install ==

 # Download the latest <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs'</a> version for your OS.
 # Download ics-os disk <a href="http://ics-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ics-os/ics-os-floppy.img">image</a>
 # Download this <a href="http://ics-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ics-os/bochsrc">bochsrc</a>. Take note of the section {{{ floppya: 1_44=ics-os-floppy.img, status=inserted }}}. This section specifies that the floppy drive contains the ics-os floppy disk image.
In linux, the disk image and bochsrc should be in the same directory. Run Bochs' using the following command
{{{
$bochs -q
}}}
In windows, the disk image and bochsrc should be placed in Bochs' installation directory.

If everything is successful, then you should see something similar to the picture below when you run Bochs. Press enter to load ics-os.
